% This simple script reverts the bit order of the raw binary file which is
% outputted by Quartus Prime Lite. The output is written to a new binary
% file. It can be used to flash the SPI (U5) before soldering it to the
% board. This may simplify production runs.
% 
% If you are working on your own DIY board, you can use this file to. The
% MiniPro TL866CS/A comes in my mind when thinking of cheap programmer
% hardware for DIY. Unfortunately the MiniPro software does not support the
% IS25LP016D but similar replacements. E.g. you can load "A25L016 @SOP8" as
% target IC, load the *_spi and uncheck "Check ID" under options. Then you
% should be able to successfully flash the SPI for your project.
