v1.67 / v1.67
=============
- center OSD window for PAL and NTSC
- simple handover of controller data betw. hard- and software
- improve clock domain transfers
- input register for video data and data sync
  (should reduce potential gradient errors due to inaccurate installation)
- automatic video PLL control
  (no need to test it and enable it anymore)

v1.66 / v1.66
=============
- add PPU feedback value to info screen
- PAL pattern detection for De-Jitter improved
- bugfixes:
  - VSYNC detection fixed for 4MHz clock domain
  - valid data window slightly shifted


v1.65 / v1.65
=============
- add support for Retro Fighters Brawler64 Wireless controller
- increase software speed by factor 2 (now at 50MHz)
- bugfixes:
  - HV sync was not working for VGA output
  - controller sniffing module (reset counter vals)
  - sub-pixel shift in OSD fixed


v1.64 / v1.64
=============
- horizontal shift for passthrough modes
- 16bit mode (replaces 15bit mode)
- menu navigation improved (added fast page switch with L/Z and R for certain configuration screens)
- Testpattern does not change LineX mode
- different bug fixes


v1.63 / v1.63
=============
- welcome screen for new firmwares
- horizontal and vertical shift for LineX2 and LineX3
- PAL Dejitter for LineX2
- reorder menu items a bit
- stability improvements

v1.60 / v1.60 (no new fw number (?))
=============
- fix timing constrains
- remove deblur stuff from jumper load


v1.60 / v1.60
=============
- remove vi-deblur heuristic (auto)
- reduce bram usage for gamma boost
- timing improvements (e.g. input timings in accordance to RCP datasheet)
- misc bug fixes

v1.58 / v1.58
=============
- show menu if N64Adv loads from jumper set at power cycle
- fixed an issue that causes video drop out if vi-deblur is disabled

v1.56 / v1.57
=============
- improve menu navigation (e.g. timeouts avoiding multiple inputs)
- improve timings (FPGA to ADV7125)
- fix line buffer clock issue


v1.55 / v1.56
